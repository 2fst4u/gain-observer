## 2024-05-18 - Expensive 3D computations in tight loops
**Learning:** In Three.js geometry generation, recalculating vertex angles (spherical coordinates from Cartesian) for `thetaDeg` and `phiDeg` on every frame or state change can be significantly expensive and redundant, especially when LOD details stay the same. Caching these arrays separately from visual attributes drastically improves performance.
**Action:** When mapping scalar data to 3D meshes (like antenna radiation patterns), cache structural calculations (like vertex spherical angles) separately from dynamic visual state (like colors or scale) using separate `useMemo` hooks.
## 2025-02-18 - Pre-allocate Arrays in Polar Plot Generation
**Performance Issue:** Dynamic array resizing via `out.push(...)` in `cutAzimuth` and `cutElevation` inside `src/components/Charts/PolarPlots.tsx` caused significant memory overhead and slowdowns when called frequently during polar chart rendering.
**Optimization:** Replaced `[]` and `push` with `new Array(size)` and populated elements using a standard `for` loop and index assignments. This eliminates reallocation and pushes array creation performance from ~361ms down to ~138ms in synthetic benchmarking.
**Action:** Always pre-allocate arrays when the exact final size is known upfront, especially in chart generation or rendering loops.

## 2024-05-18 - Optimized Zenith Gain Fetch
**Learning:** In spherical coordinates used by the NEC-2 engine (theta=0 at zenith), the direction vector is straight up regardless of the azimuth (phi) step.
**Action:** Replace $O(N)$ averaging loops over `phi` at zenith with a direct $O(1)$ sample from `data[0]` to fetch the gain faster, avoiding redundant memory reads in the JS engine.
